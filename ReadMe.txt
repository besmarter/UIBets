The input file is an additional file with information from every available bookmaker regarding one specific match. The structure should be as follows:


OddHome1	OddDraw1	OddAway1
OddHome2	OddDraw2	OddAway2
â€¦
OddHomeN	OddDrawN	OddAwayN

Where N is the number of available bookmakers

In other words, is a .txt file tab delimited where each file is a different bookmaker
